os.path.abspath(path)
Return a normalized absolutized version of the pathname path. On most platforms, 
this is equivalent to calling the function normpath() as follows: normpath(join(os.getcwd(), path)).

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

os.path.basename(path)
Return the base name of pathname path. This is the second element of the pair 
returned by passing path to the function split(). 
Note that the result of this function is different from the Unix basename 
program; where basename for '/foo/bar/' returns 'bar', the basename() function returns an empty string ('').
